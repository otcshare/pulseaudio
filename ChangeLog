	7f0cf0c: Fix up a couple of values related to encoding overhead.

2008-05-26	Colin Guthrie
	13bc075: A few related changes:
	b93e9e8: Keep track of the memblock pointer internally and do not rely on subsequent calls to pass it back in for unref'ing
	8108121: Set forgotten keyword property
	6dc5e07: Set the send buffer size to prevent rendering silence in amongst our good data (this should be more sophisticated but that can wait for a glitch-free port)
	6c1dd6e: Move the encoding loop around a bit such that it does not grab the data and keep it for the next loop iteration.

2008-05-11	Colin Guthrie
	3767cdb: Do tidy up on disconnection.
	9216684: Do not prefix internal function rtsp_exec.

	4b7b7b1: Fix up IPv6 address format to enclose it in []
	d195d06: Change suggested by Lennart. Do not return a memchunk, instead pass in the pointer.
	e00127f: Various changes suggested by Lennart.
	ec9a618: Listen to the on_close callback. This still causes asserts in the mainloop, so this is not a complete solution
	899492c: Add a new callback structure to propigate when the RTSP connection dies
	5eecfa2: Move the ownership of the encoded data memchunk into the raop_client.
	4dd3185: Do not assert on NULL values of s. This means the connection was closed. This change somehow kills the mainloop with an assert, so I need to sort that out.
	d51f594: A very rough first version of the sink.
	264a1c2: Add more libraries to librtp now that it's doing a lot more.

2008-05-06	Colin Guthrie
	22e299a: Add a pa_iochannel callback for when the RAOP connection connects.
	8fb58e3: Add a function for packing bits into a byte buffer. This will be needed when encoding the audio data in ALAC format.

	20478a4: Add a skeleton raop client which builds on the rtsp client.

	8bc58cc: ignore sinks that do not carry decibel information
	776c8de: remove $Id$
	b6ccea3: add a comment that pa_sink_input_set_volume and module-flat-volume.c are related

	78ae612: Perfer client.conf over X11 property variables. To explain: X11 properties are always set on the root window if pulseaudio is started during X11 login (which is the most likey time to start it). This means that any settings specified in client.conf will almost never be used. As the default client.conf is empty it makes more sense to listen to it if a user cares to bother altering it.

	52e3628: Yes, yet another evil all-in-one commit of intervowen changes. I suck. * Drop "state" directory, fold that into "runtime directory" * No longer automatically rewind when a new stream connects * Rework sound file stream, to cause a rewind on initialisation, shorten _pop() code a bit * Fix reference counting of pa_socket_server in the protocol implementations * Rework daemon initialization code to be compatible with non-SUID-root setups where RLIMIT_RTPRIO is non-zero * Print warning if RT/HP is enabled in the config, but due to missing caps, rlimits, policy we cannot enable it. * Fix potential memory leak in pa_open_config_file() * Add pa_find_config_file() which works much like pa_open_config_file() but doesn't actually open the config file in question. Just searches for it. * Add portable pa_is_path_absolute() * Add pa_close_all() and use it on daemon startup to close leaking file descriptors (inspired from what I did for libdaemon) * Add pa_unblock_sigs() and use it on daemon startup to unblock all signals (inspired from libdaemon, too) * Add pa_reset_sigs() and use it on daemon startup to reset all signal handlers (inspired from libdaemon as well) * Implement pa_set_env() * Define RLIMIT_RTTIME and friends if not defined by glibc * Add pa_strempty() * rename state testing macros to include _IS_, to make clearer that they are no states, but testing macros * Implement pa_source_output_set_requested_latency_within_thread() to be able to forward latency info to sources from within the IO thread * Similar for sink inputs * generelize since_underrun counter in sink inputs to "playing_for" and "underrun_for". Use only this for ignore potential rewind requests over underruns * Add new native protocol message PLAYBACK_STREAM_MESSAGE_STARTED for notification about the end of an underrun * Port native protocol to use underrun_for/playing_for which is maintained by the sink input anyway * Pass underrun_for/playing_for in timing info to client * Drop pa_sink_skip() since it breaks underrun detection code * Move PID file and unix sockets to the runtime dir (i.e. ~/.pulse). This fixes a potention DoS attack from other users stealing dirs in /tmp from us so that we cannot take them anymore) * Allow setting of more resource limits from the config file. Set RTTIME by default * Streamline daemon startup code * Rework algorithm to find default configuration files * If run in system mode use "system.pa" instead of "default.pa" as default script file * Change ladspa sink to use pa_clamp_samples() for clamping samples * Teach module-null-sink how to deal with rewinding * Try to support ALSA devices with no implicit channel map. Synthesize one by padding with PA_CHANNEL_POSITION_AUX channels. This is not tested since I lack hardware with these problems. * Make use of time smoother in the client libraries. * Add new pa_stream_is_corked() and pa_stream_set_started_callback() functions to public API * Since our native socket moved, add some code for finding sockets created by old versions of PA. This should ease upgrades

	f49df7a: * Increase history set to 64 to simplify reduction of indexes * Decrease memory consumption a bit by using bitfields for some bools * Rework reduction code * Drop an unnessacary counter * Before adding a new entry to the history, try to figure out if we already have an existing entry with the same x value and replace that. This fixes a division by zero * Fix up input x for all functions, according to the time offset

	c8fc223: add stripnul to build
	76031df: Big pile of interdependant changes: * Fix a deadlock when an asyncq overflows and an RT thread needed to wait until space became available again while the main thread was waiting for a operation to complete and thus didn't free any new items. Now, if the asyncq overflows, queue those items temporarily, and return immediately. Then, when the queue becomes writable again, flush it. * Modify pa_thread_mq_init() to also set up pa_rtpoll events properly for the MQ * Some more pa_bool_t'ization * Unify more common code between alsa-sink and alsa-source * The upper limit for the tsched watermark is max_use minus one frame * make module-alsa-source work * make the alsa modules use pa_alsa_build_pollfd() now * fix detection of dB scale for alsa-source

	e16a198: - Change meaning of special values of latency request: 0 -> "minimal latency, please"; (pa_usec_t)-1 -> "don't care" - Remove "source" word from monitor source description - Increase default tsched watermark to 20ms again - For the first iteration after snd_pcm_start() halve the sleep time as workaround for USB devices with quick starts

2007-09-28	Lennart Poettering
	67b899a: treat timer_enabled like a real, grown-up boolean variable
	33f2f49: rework module-combine once again. We now run the data generation always in a seperate thread. This should help use to avoid all the awful race conditions we had in previously
	229afb5: Move the poll() call outside the #ifdef checking for ppoll, since we want the poll in all cases. Prior to this change the check for negative return values of poll/ppoll was never actually executed when ppoll() was available

	ef020c6: fix stream corking: ignore pa_sink_input() when we are in corked state
	55651ec: don't count streams using the monitor source in pa_sink_used_by(), because this would disallow suspending a sink ehn an rtp stream is connected
	ba322a4: drop the PA_SOURCE_CAN_SUSPEND and PA_SINK_CAN_SUSPEND flags, since they were a bad idea in the first place. All sinks/sources are now *required* to handle suspending in one way or another. Luckily all current sink/source implementations handle it fine anyway.

2007-09-23	Lennart Poettering
	77ed60c: instead of using the mixer ioctl()s on the dsp fd, open a seperate fd for the mixer. This allows us the keep the mixer fd open while closing the dsp device while suspending.

	d716e3c: fix check for lrintf, make resample2.c again identical to upstream ffmpeg
	75f799a: make O_CLOEXEC, O_NONBLOCK and socket low latency fd ops more uniform: always return void, name them similarly, only pass a single fd
	0fcad97: copy free_cb into a temporary variable first, to avoid compiler warning

2007-09-18	Lennart Poettering
	ac66b6a: fall back to plughw:, if hw: doesn't work, in the alsa source, too
	781cf49: properly release memblock always abd as soon as possible
	1fd9afd: make use of pa_bool_t on a few places where applicable; really start work_cb
	b3093d8: lower SO_PRIORITY priority to 6, since this is the best we get without being root

	08d4b23: actually close the alsa device before we try to reopen it as plughw

2007-09-18	Pierre Ossman
	4ed41f3: strtof() is a rather recent addition to C. Fall back to strtod() if it isn't available.
	aff22cf: NSIG seems to be more common than _NSIG.
	03d9863: Emulate lrintf with simple truncation if it isn't available.
	31dfb31: Make sure the header file is only included on linux (as this is a linux-only feature).
	df1d347: NSIG is not defined by neither C99 nor POSIX so we can't rely on it.

2007-09-17	Lennart Poettering
	4cde507: add LADSPA sink than can be piggy-backed ontop of another sink
	7b4f981: print a message when we fall back on plughw

	4cdf2ce: hide sig2str-test
	1ae473b: fall back to plughw: if hw: doesn't work
	26a1ae7: Rename pa_strsignal() to pa_sig2str(), since we return the symbolical signal name, not a human readable string. This follows the Solaris API of sig2str() a bit. Also, add all remaining signals to the list of signal names.
	d3b8985: drop a couple of WARNING prefixes in log messages, since we have pa_log_warn anyway for marking warnings especially

	8389264: count corked streams per sink/source and make pa_sink_used_by() return only the number of streams that are not corked. Introduce pa_sink_linked_by() returning the number of streams connected at all. This will allow suspending of sinks/sources when all streams connected to a sink are corked.

	5ae4eed: Move attaching/detaching from a pa_rtpoll into pa_sink proper, remove it from module-combine
	3396b65: simplify rt loops a bit by moving more code into pa_rtpoll. It is now possible to attach "work" functions to a pa_rtpoll_item, which will be called in each loop iteration.

	eaafb79: Modified the JACK sink heavily: * Made the sink realtime-safe. * To achieve the previous item, internal buffering was be added. New module   argument: buffersize. * Removed the user's need to set the JACK transport to playing state before he   could hear anything from PulseAudio. * In process of achieving the previous item, latency calculation got more   inaccurate: the reported latency is now always a multiple of the JACK   processing block size, and constant. * The JACK ports now have a running numbering in their names.

	c3fc2ea: update tests for new memory manager
	0e436a6: Rework memory management to allow shared memory data transfer. The central idea is to allocate all audio memory blocks from a per-process memory pool which is available as read-only SHM segment to other local processes. Then, instead of writing the actual audio data to the socket just write references to this shared memory pool.

	dcd3acc: remove OSS specific code from module-hal-detect if HAVE_OSS is not set. Same for ALSA
	7a4e1c9: ALSA: handle write()/read() errors properly by unloading the driver module. This should fix problems when removing USB audio device while pulseaudio is running.
	b0b968d: change order of the ALSA event dispatch code to make sure that the code survives if the event dispatcher frees the ALSA client

	a1e8b09: add new CLI function "move-sink-input" as wrapper around pa_sink_input_move_to()
	5e92950: * implement "hot" moving of playback streams between sinks (pa_sink_input_move_to()). * optimize the adjusting of the volume in pa_sink_input_peek() a little
	4dd3b31: free the memblockq if we decide not to play it
	f15b4c7: if the memblockq is empty, return -1 in all cases
	9310a2e: fix calculation of pa_usec_to_bytes, to make sure that it never returns fractions of a frame size
	b325e07: handle EOF correctly if it is read before the stream was created

2006-07-28	Lennart Poettering
	d1db037: for the playing field of pa_timing_info use pa_sink_input::state == PA_SINK_INPUT_RUNNING. This means that this variable will now refer to the current state and not to the expected future state, which is probably more what clients expect.
	f1c4611: fold the seperate variable pa_sink_input::playing into pa_sink_input::state as state PA_SINK_INPUT_DRAINED. The following mappings hold:
	12aa842: introduce pa_play_memblockq() which creates a playback stream and passes the data from the memblockq to it. after that is done, frees the memblockq

	c21f88c: load module-gconf in default install
	0dea223: introduce three virtual sink/source names: @DEFAULT_SINK@, @DEFAULT_SOURCE@, @DEFAULT_MONITOR@. Especially the latter is useful for connecting to the monitor source of the default sink.
	fec7e9b: if possible do not unload already loaded modules when the gconf settings change. instead try to reuse already loaded modules as much as possible
	87d4f0b: because gconf doesn't provide real transactions we emulate our own with a "locked" gconf key

	563fab9: Results of profiling PulseAudio with valgrind's callgrind module: rework the default event loop implementation to use PA_LLIST_xxx instead of pa_idxset; don't generate weakeup events if we aren't in STATE_POLLING; minimize dispatching of io events; cache next time event instead of traversing the list of time events on every event loop iteration; other optimizations
	216bdd4: split a few asserts
	32444f0: split a few assert()s
	c41d749: add a few more g_assert()s and change all assert()s to g_assert()s

	c85351b: as a result of memory profiling with valgrind/massif: decrease default hash table size from 1024 to 127. the hashtables are sparsely filled most of the time, so there is no point in allocating to much memory by default.

	30ada90: add IP address ACL subsystem
	2409f1a: add support to set resource limits for the daemon and set some of them to some sane values
	0ff247d: undo r1111 in some way: include sys/socket.h and sys/un.h but wrap it in #ifdef HAVE_xxx_H. This should be safe because config.h should be the first included header in all .c files and creds.h is never included by any external tools

2006-07-19	Lennart Poettering
	703bb49: add a few comments
	a382492: * add new function pa_check_in_group() * abstract credential APis a little bit by introducing HAVE_CREDS and a structure pa_creds * rework credential authentication * fix module-volume-restore and friends for usage in system-wide instance * remove loopback= argument from moulde-*-protocol-tcp since it is a superset of listen= and usually a bad idea anyway since the user shouldn't load the TCP module at all if he doesn't want remote access * rename a few variables in the jack modules to make sure they don't conflict with symbols defined in the system headers * add server address for system-wide daemons to the default server list for the the client libs * update todo

	55a8db8: improve latency calculation of NULL sink
	d43bcb3: update todo
	b8f9ae0: remove checking for SIGPIPE blocking from client code. Because we use send(,,MSG_NOSIGNAL) for most socket writes now the reason for SIGPIPE blocking is no longer give. We keep this check for the server side however, because pipes create SIGPIPE too but cannot be used with MSG_NOSIGNAL. Some modules use pipes for internal and external communication.
	fc544a6: don't send SCM_CREDENTIALS on every sendmsg(), instead do it only on handshake
	3eeecdc: don't set MSG_NOSIGNAL for recvmsg(), since it doesn't make sense there
	860be2e: try to use send(,,MSG_NOSIGNAL) instead of write() wherever possible (which will allow us to drop the SIGPIPE check). Cache the results of the last write()/send() to make sure that we do not issue more than necessary system calls.
	350a253: remove vi'ism
	dfd864a: update todo
	883ce83: add new test get-binary-name-test for testing pa_get_binary_name()
	a87c43d: Don't call pa_path_get_filename() anymore since it is implicitly called by pa_get_binary_name() anyway
	881d4dd: * fall back to prctl(PR_GET_NAME) in pa_get_binary_name() if readlink() fails * call pa_path_get_filename() in all cases before returning in pa_get_binary_name(). We already did so on Win32, but didn't on Linux.

2006-03-31	Pierre Ossman
	acb96c9: Fix some warnings caused by size_t having varying size.
	3285403: Large file support. Polypaudio probably doesn't need it, but it causes warnings when linking libpolyp with applications that do. So this is just to make life easier for other applications.

	6457137: Trying to listen on an IPv6 socket by default and only do IPv4 if that fails (which it doesn't most of the time) is terribly confusing. What the user most likely wants is for it to listen to both IPv4 and IPv6 and gracefully continue if only of them succeed.

	104797b: Use AC_SEARCH_LIBS instead of AC_CHECK_LIBS since it is a lot smarter and doesn't add unnecessary libs.

2006-01-20	Pierre Ossman
	30bb5ce: Fix so that peer name can be determined on Windows. We do not support console on Windows at this time so we do not have to worry about that right now.

2006-01-19	Pierre Ossman
	60dbf8b: Open the device in non-blocking mode.
	0ca9a0e: Ugly hack to get around Solaris particularly brain dead sound system. The system has a buffer size of 0.5 MB which cannot be changed. We emulate a smaller buffer through some SIGPOLL trickery.

2006-01-16	Pierre Ossman
	719c377: We need a logical, not an arithmetic shift here. So use unsigned types when doing the shifting.

2006-01-12	Pierre Ossman
	262c60f: Under win32 we freed the wrong pointer causing a segmentation fault.
	cb2a7ed: Some crappy hardware generate noise on the output when reading input. To avoid triggering this needlesly we tweak the algorithm a bit to avoid reading when nothing is connected to the source.
	289c914: Some drivers (via82xx) doesn't start recording until we read something. This is ugly, but unfortunately required.
	fc93e4b: Used 0 as an invalid fd. Changed to -1.
	f61be8b: If the card couldn't do duplex when required we would incorrectly return success from this function with a closed fd.

2006-01-11	Pierre Ossman
	72316cc: Many (FSF and Sun at least) have interpreted the C99 standard in a way that int64_t and similar types are only defined on 64 bit platforms. Using -std=gnu99 lifts this rather silly restriction.
	2623edc: Remove the old compiler flag test now that we have a new shiny one.
	70ac72e: Our makefiles work just fine on older automakes (1.7 tested). Let's keep this out until we run into something that doesn't work.

2006-01-11	Lennart Poettering
	1f09613: * remove a lot of compiler warnings introduced by using some new GCC flags * add typedefs for public structs and enums and drop the struct/enum prefixs from all uses where it makes sense

2006-01-10	Lennart Poettering
	6c512fb: build system updates, including support for some newer GCC options

	d429222: Accidental use of a swapped int.
	11c6cac: buf is needed on Windows aswell.
	abdf9b1: Add needed error code.
	0a9abdd: Unfortunately Windows has two different values for EBADF depending on if it's a file or a socket. We'll have to deal with these as they show up.
	ba06340: Add some required headers.
	357ab88: Make sure socklen_t is defined.
	5e5808a: Static libs bork the creation of dlls and AC_CHECK_LIB isn't very bright, so we have to do a test first to see if getopt_long() is included in the system libs.
	ff4cc62: Move library checks to a separate section and make sure it's before function checks. It could miss functions because they are hidden in extra libs otherwise.
	f5a2cf1: getopt_long resides in libiberty on many platforms.

2006-01-09	Pierre Ossman
	76bc56c: Put inet_ntop() emulation in a seperate file.
	d3cb144: Update comment for pa_lock_fd() to reflect that locks are mandatory on Windows.
	160d886: Merge with trunk.
	8258146: Generalise lstat fallback.
	5fcbf04: Condense winsock includes and defines into one header.

	2cf165d: ifdef-protect setpgid and setsid.
	08bbfd2: Make it possible to disable caps support since it breaks fully static builds.
	be2ba90: Add option to select which modules get linked in during static builds.
	9550c8e: No need for conditional generation of symdef files.
	971e370: Add possibility for linking semi-static executables (libtools definition of static).
	e2495c7: We need explicit actions here.
	268aebb: Protect sys/wait.h with an ifdef.
	8f3c364: Make sure all socket headers are protected by ifdefs.
	e28ce8c: Use pa_get_path_filename() instead of duplicating code.
	29a5b85: Emulate poll() through select() where needed.
	d3bc7b2: Fix test for mkfifo(). HAVE_MKFIFO is only generated as a config.h define by default.
	5cd8703: Remove ftruncate test since we're not doing anything with the result.
	a24102c: Fix indentation.
	e9be6fa: Handle platforms that do not support the UNIX user/group database.
	59aa6ca: There was a race condition here that caused latency calculation to fail miserably under some conditions.
	ec87cb1: Fall back to signal() when sigaction isn't supported.
	3ed983c: SIGQUIT is an optional signal.
	b8859b4: Compiler warning about uninitialized variable.
	3728854: Make sure the array is never too small.
	b69d881: Fix printf string.
	7192238: Old kernel headers didn't define the input_id structure. Therefore we cannot rely on it.
	c5bee95: Fix correct type.
	4deeaef: Don't include sys/socket.h in the header when we do not need to.
	14474ae: Esound latency should not include buffer length. This added an extra second to esound already horrible latency calculations.
	f0e8c65: Two variables with the same name causing corrupt strings.
	4384d31: Fix warning.
	ff49e63: inet_ntop can't be found on all platforms. Do a stupid emulation when not found.
	456e256: Fix some compiler warnings about unused variables.
	cd3691d: PIPE_BUF has nothing to do with the esound buffers.
	13496bb: Handle when the platform doesn't have UNIX sockets.
	3a3b4af: AF_UNIX and PF_UNIX is more portable than the _LOCAL equivalent.
	dbad54a: Remove any warnings about incorrect type to setsockopt() (char* vs void*).
	7dcf4e4: The standard declares some signals as optional. Make sure we handle this gracefully.
	eacffc3: To access the new pa_gettimeofday() we need to include util.h.
	8c5a75d: Syslog is not present on all platforms.
	3996c5f: SIXCPU isn't present on all platforms. Replace cpulimit with dummy functions on those systems.
	2ce05b2: Glob is not present on all systems.
	70223ba: Fallbacks for systems that do not have getaddrinfo(). Does not handle IPv6 though.
	3f2ac7e: We have a generic function for extracting the filename, let's use it.
	f6b0f87: Remove unnecessary dependency on timeval definition.
	687e2d7: Abstract the gettimeofday call into a utility function to ease porting.
	70710e1: Check for OSS by looking for its header. Win32 isn't the only platform where OSS isn't supported.
	11a4c67: Remove unused automake conditional.
	e8c71ed: Since README is generated conditionally we must make sure there are no dependencies on it when it's not built.
	1f11ee3: Big cleanup of the build structure.
	22f6694: Creating branch for patches from Pierre Ossman
